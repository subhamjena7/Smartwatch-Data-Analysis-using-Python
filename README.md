# Smartwatch-Data-Analysis-using-Python
The dataset I am using for Smartwatch data analysis is publicly available on Kaggle. This dataset was initially collected from 30 female users of the Fitbit smartwatch.

Problem Statement :
To analyze a dataset containing fitness information from 30 smartwatch users who participated in an online survey between December 2016 and May 2017. The dataset comprises minute-by-minute records of activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns. Each user wore different smartwatch models and had unique activity preferences, contributing to the diversity within the data. We are exploring this dataset to examine the relationship between daily calorie counts and minutes of activity for these smartwatch users allowing us to predict early warning signals of underlying health issues.
